# Advanced Mathematical Problem Solver

A professional, user-friendly GUI application for solving a wide range of mathematical problems, from basic arithmetic to advanced topics. The application provides detailed solution steps, visualizations, and supports both English and Thai mathematical notation.

## Features
- Solve equations (linear, quadratic, fractional, radical, complex)
- System of equations (with graphical visualization for 2 variables)
- Calculus (derivatives, integrals, limits)
- Trigonometry (with function plotting)
- Statistics (with data visualization)
- Geometry (with shape visualization)
- Linear algebra (matrices, determinants, eigenvalues)
- Advanced mathematical topics (group theory, topology, etc.)
- Automatic problem type detection
- Step-by-step solutions
- Robust error handling and input normalization
- English interface (with Thai support in solver)
- Powered by Yokception
